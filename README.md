# jc2mp-buymenu-twovec
This script was originally created by Philpax (Phillip Larkson). I commit some changes like:
- Two vehicles per player (one which is used by player disappear)
- Added weapons from DLC
- Added some vehicles (all from DLC and some more interesting which weren't included)
- Price divided by 10

# jc2mp-buymenu

The JC2-MP buy menu script implements a fully-featured buy menu within the game, allowing you to purchase vehicles, weapons and skins.

## Adding new items

Edit shared/buymenu.lua - inside, you will find lists of vehicles, weapons and skins. Edit these as appropriate to add and modify the items you want. The DLC items have been commented out; you can easily re-add these if you would like to use them on your server.
